Launch the VM. Open the AttackBox and execute nmap -sT 10.10.119.52 via the terminal. A new service has been installed on this VM since our last scan. Which port number was closed in the scan above but is now open on this target VM?

Not shown: 994 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
25/tcp  open  smtp
80/tcp  open  http
110/tcp open  pop3
111/tcp open  rpcbind
143/tcp open  imap

+	111

What is Nmap’s guess about the newly installed service?
+	pop3

1.	Launch the VM. Some new server software has been installed since the last time we scanned it. On the AttackBox, use the terminal to execute nmap -sS 10.10.193.72. What is the new open port?

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
25/tcp   open  smtp
80/tcp   open  http
110/tcp  open  pop3
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
143/tcp  open  imap
6667/tcp open  irc
```

+	6667

2.	What is Nmap’s guess of the service name?

```Task 7 Fine-Tuning Scope and Performance ```

1.	What is the option to scan all the TCP ports between 5000 and 5500?
+	-p5000-5500
2.	How can you ensure that Nmap will run at least 64 probes in parallel?
+	--min-parallelism 64
3.	What option would you add to make Nmap very slow and paranoid?
+	-T0

``` Summary ```
```
This room covered three types of scans.
Port Scan Type 	Example Command
TCP Connect Scan 	nmap -sT 10.10.213.102
TCP SYN Scan 	sudo nmap -sS 10.10.213.102
UDP Scan 	sudo nmap -sU 10.10.213.102

These scan types should get you started discovering running TCP and UDP services on a target host.
Option 	Purpose
-p- 	all ports
-p1-1023 	scan ports 1 to 1023
-F 	100 most common ports
-r 	scan ports in consecutive order
-T<0-5> 	-T0 being the slowest and T5 the fastest
--max-rate 50 	rate <= 50 packets/sec
--min-rate 15 	rate >= 15 packets/sec
--min-parallelism 100 	at least 100 probes in parallel
```
