`
Any time you browse over HTTP, you are susceptible to a MITM attack, and the scary thing is that you cannot recognize it. Many tools would aid you in carrying out such an attack, such as Ettercap and Bettercap.
`

### How many different interfaces does Ettercap offer?
https://www.ettercap-project.org/about.html
`3`

### In how many ways can you invoke Bettercap?
https://www.bettercap.org/usage/
`3`

###	Use SSH to connect to 10.10.81.99 as mark with the password XBtc49AB. Using uname -r, find the Kernel release?

###	Use SSH to download the file book.txt from the remote system. How many KBs did scp display as download size?

<details><summary> Password Attack </summary>

```
We want an automated way to try the common passwords or the entries from a word list; here comes THC Hydra. Hydra supports many protocols, including FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SSH, and all methods related to HTTP. The general command-line syntax is: hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service where we specify the following options:

    -l username: -l should precede the username, i.e. the login name of the target.
    -P wordlist.txt: -P precedes the wordlist.txt file, which is a text file containing the list of passwords you want to try with the provided username.
    server is the hostname or IP address of the target server.
    service indicates the service which you are trying to launch the dictionary attack.

Consider the following concrete examples:

    hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.81.99 ftp will use mark as the username as it iterates over the provided passwords against the FTP server.
    hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.81.99 is identical to the previous example. 10.10.81.99 ftp is the same as ftp://10.10.81.99.
    hydra -l frank -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.81.99 ssh will use frank as the user name as it tries to login via SSH using the different passwords.

There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:

    -s PORT to specify a non-default port for the service in question.
    -V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations that are being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you are still not confident of your command-line syntax.
    -t n where n is the number of parallel connections to the target. -t 16 will create 16 threads used to connect to the target.
    -d, for debugging, to get more detailed information about whatâ€™s going on. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this right away.

```

###	We learned that one of the email accounts is lazie. What is the password used to access the IMAP service on 10.10.81.99? 
```bash
hydra -l lazie -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.81.99 imap
