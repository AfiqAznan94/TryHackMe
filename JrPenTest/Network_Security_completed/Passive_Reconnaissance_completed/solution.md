```Task 2 - Passive Versus Active Recon ```

    whois to query WHOIS servers
    nslookup to query DNS servers
    dig to query DNS servers

We use whois to query WHOIS records, while we use nslookup and dig to query DNS database records. These are all publicly available records and hence do not alert the target.
We will also learn the usage of two online services:

    DNSDumpster
    Shodan.io

```Passive```

    In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target. Think of it like you are looking at target territory from afar without stepping foot on that territory.

```Active```

    Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, cannot be achieved so discreetly. It requires direct engagement with the target. Think of it like you check the locks on the doors and windows, among other potential entry points.

```diff
You visit the Facebook page of the target company, hoping to get some of their employee names. What kind of reconnaissance activity is this? (A for active, P for passive)
+   P
You ping the IP address of the company webserver to check if ICMP traffic is blocked. What kind of reconnaissance activity is this? (A for active, P for passive)
+   A
You happen to meet the IT administrator of the target company at a party. You try to use social engineering to get more information about their systems and network infrastructure. What kind of reconnaissance activity is this? (A for active, P for passive)
+   A
```

```Task 3 - Whois ```
On the AttackBox, open the terminal and run the whois tryhackme.com command to get the information you need to answer the following questions.
```diff
When was TryHackMe.com registered?
+   20180705
What is the registrar of TryHackMe.com?
+   Namecheap.com
Which company is TryHackMe.com using for name servers?
+   cloudflare.com
```

```Task 4 nslookup and dig ```

Using the AttackBox, open the terminal and use the nslookup or dig command to get the information you need to answer the following question.
Check the TXT records of thmlabs.com. What is the flag there?
```diff
!   dig thmlabs.com TXT
+   THM{a5b83929888ed36acb0272971e438d78}
```
```Task 5 - DNSDumpster ```
https://dnsdumpster.com/

Lookup tryhackme.com on DNSDumpster. What is one interesting subdomain that you would discover in addition to www and blog?
```diff
+   remote
```

```Task 6 - Shodan.io ```
```diff
According to Shodan.io, what is the 2nd country in the world in terms of the number of publicly accessible Apache servers?
+   Germany
Based on Shodan.io, what is the 3rd most common port used for Apache?
+   8080
Based on Shodan.io, what is the 3rd most common port used for nginx?
+   8888
```

```Task 7 - Summary ```
```diff
