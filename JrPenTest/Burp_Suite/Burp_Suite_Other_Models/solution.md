	URL Decode this data: %4e%65%78%74%3a%20%44%65%63%6f%64%69%6e%67
	What is the plaintext returned?
	-	Next: Decoding

	Use Smart Decode to decode this data: &#x25;&#x33;&#x34;&#x25;&#x33;&#x37;
	What is the decoded text?
	-	47

	Encode this phrase: Encoding Challenge
	Start with base64 encoding. Take the output of this and convert it into ASCII Hex. Finally, encode the hex string into octal.
	What is the final string?

	First, download the file attached to this task.
	Note: This file can also be downloaded from the deployed VM with  wget http://10.10.148.201:9999/AlteredKeys.zip -- you may find this useful if you are using the AttackBox.
	Now read the problem specification below:
	"Some joker has messed with my SSH key! There are four keys in the directory, and I have no idea which is the real one. The MD5 hashsum for my key is ```3166226048d6ad776370dc105d40d9f8``` -- could you find it for me?"
	Submit the correct key name as your answer.
