```Task 11 - Practical Challenge```
```diff	
The home interface shows us a table of tickets -- if we click on any of the rows in the table, we get redirected to a page where we can view the full ticket. Looking at the URL, we can see that these pages are numbered, e.g.:
	http://10.10.77.5/support/ticket/NUMBER


	Which attack type is best suited for this task?
+	Sniper

	Configure an appropriate position and payload (the tickets are stored at values between 1 and 100), then start the attack.
	You should find that at least five tickets will be returned with a status code of 200, indicating that they exist.
	
	Either using the Response tab in the Attack Results window or by looking at each successful (i.e. 200 code) request manually in your browser, find the ticket that contains the flag.

	What is the flag?
+	First create wordlist 1 to 100 using - for i in {1..100}; do echo $i; done | tee num.txt
+	then using sniper to brute force base on num.txt
