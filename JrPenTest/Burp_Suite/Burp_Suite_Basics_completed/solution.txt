Task 13 - Site Map and Issue Definitions 
Take a look around the site on http://MACHINE_IP/ -- we will be using this a lot throughout the module. Visit every page linked to from the homepage, then check your sitemap -- one endpoint should stand out as being very unusual!

Visit this in your browser (or use the "Response" section of the site map entry for that endpoint)

What is the flag you receive?
